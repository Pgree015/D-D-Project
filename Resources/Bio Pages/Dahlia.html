            <p> Dahlia was born to a hereditary line of powerful oracles, but she was not the one chosen to carry the gift.
                Her sister Delphie, as the oldest, is the chosen oracle for the entire generation.
                Unfortunately, Delphie disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
                In exchange for the power to conduct a potentially dangerous search for Delphie, Dahlia decided to become a warlock.
                Dahlia's patron is the divine Solar, Septimus, who presides over the 19th hour of the day.
                Driven by a mixture of guilt, honor, and hope, Dahlia searches the lands of Barovia with her sister's fiance, Percy, hoping to find any sign of her lost sister.
