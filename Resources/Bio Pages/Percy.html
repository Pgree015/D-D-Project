            <p>Percy is a young man who works for his family's detective agency as an investigator.
                Unfortunately, he isn't that great of a detective, 
                and relies on his abilities to briefly glimpse into the future to aid him in his investigations.
                His precognitive gifts are part of what he has in common with his fiancee, Delphie, who has gone missing.
                Percy is on a quest to find Delphie, with the help of her sister, Dahlia.
                Percy finds the land of Barovia harrowing, and in spite of his caution, 
                he is rarely able to keep anyone besides himself and Dahlia out of harm's way.
