            <p>Rysstyl's parents were killed while he was still very young, and he was raised by an aristocratic uncle with strong ties to the Feywild.
                Rysstyl's uncle was cold and neglectful and in spite of the lavish surroundings, Rysstyl always felt out of place.
                He left home without a word before he came of age, roaming the wilds until he came to Saltmarsh.
                Rysstyl quickly joined the city guard, using his keen mind and eye for detail to become a skilled investigator.
                Unfortunately, his reckless and hasty behavior often saw him in trouble and he eventually found himself removed from his position.
                He works as a mercenary, taking jobs with his best friend Bart and an unwitting crew of characters they met at bar.
