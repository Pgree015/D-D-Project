                <p>Abandoned by his parents at a young age, Zane was raised by a crime lord named Faciane.
                    Well-raised and well-educated, Zane was fiercely loyal to his adoptive father and eagerly served Faciane as an enforcer.
                    Zane's father eventually encouraged him to leave for Waterdeep and start a life free from organized crime.
                    Zane joined with his friends to work as a co-owner and musician at Shoot the Moon nightclub.
                    He enjoys the honest lifestyle, but business rivalries and odd-jobs continually pull him into situations that draw Zane back into old habits...
